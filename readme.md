# Email Validation 
This code is used for checking that an email is valid or not. The workflow is very simple, you just need to have an input field for the email address to be typed in with a class of 'email' and type='email'. Next wrap the error-message in a <small> tag with a class of 'emailError'. And lastly, add a class of 'form-submit' to the form-submit button.
